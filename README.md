# Star Wars Episode 0 Interactive RPG Game // Python 3.x.x
The following repository contains a python project implementing an interactive game, based on Star Wars fictional universe.

 Description
 
 (The game is still in a very early stage of development)
 (Python 3.x.x)
 At the beginning of every new game you will be granted the opportunity to choose whether you will play as a promising young Jedi padawan or a ruthless Sith apprentice. Your choice will literally make your game. Both the Light side and the Dark side have their own pros and cons. From this step on different obstacles will be expecting you. 
Inspite of testing your skills with a lightsaber, the game will test our reactions, ways of thinking, IQ, basic knoweledge etc.
 - single player 
 - console interface
 - jedi/sith - different set of skills at game start
 - improvement for your hero after each successfully done task
Obstacles and tasks - the main purpose of the game is to be interactive and test your brain. Special methods will be implemented in the Game class. These methods will be various mini-games. Each and every mini-game's purpose will be to test you. Whether you know the right answer among a,b,c,d or how good you are at math and calculating matrices' product. Every mini-game method will generate random values each time it's called, keeping the game's obstacles unique. General questions regarding basic knowedge about the world will be included. (possibly updated)
Purpose of the game - Develop your full potential or basically your /force/ attribute must reach 100. You lose the game if you die or lose your connection with the force( /force/ attribute gets <=0).

MINI Games examples:
- chose between a,b,c,d (At what age Master Yoda died),(Product of vectors v1(1,2,5) . v2(4,2,0),(You were ambushed, what will you do?)
- input answer (derivative of 5x^3),(fast typing a phrase)


- to be done -  ||
                \/
- update mini games (diversity must be achieved)
- basic classes' implementation (player,jedi,sith,game)
- replacement of 'set','get' methods with @property based ones
- unit testing
- ... more
