# Star Wars Jedi Legacy
The following repository contains a python project implementing an interactive game, based on Star Wars fictional universe.

# Description
- Developed on Python 3.x.x
- Single player 
- Console interface
- Jedi/Sith - different set of skills at game start
- Improvement for your hero after each successfully done task
- Inspite of testing your skills with a lightsaber, the game will test our reactions, ways of thinking, IQ, basic knoweledge etc.
- Purpose of the game: Develop the full potential of your powers. ( /force/ attribute must reach 100 )

MINI Games examples:
- chose between a,b,c,d (At what age Master Yoda died),(Product of vectors v1(1,2,5) . v2(4,2,0),(You were ambushed, what will you do?)
- input answer (derivative of 5x^3),(fast typing a phrase)


# To be done

- update mini games (diversity must be achieved)
- basic classes' implementation (player,jedi,sith,game)
- replacement of 'set','get' methods with @property based ones
- unit testing
- more
